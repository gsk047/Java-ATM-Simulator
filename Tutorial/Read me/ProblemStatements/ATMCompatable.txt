1. Goal: Create a rulebook that says "Anything that wants to use this ATM must have these three abilities."

File Name: ATMCompatible.java

Type: interface (not class)

Requirements: Declare three method signatures (no body/curly braces {}).

getBalance(): Returns a double.

deposit(): Takes a double amount and returns void.

withDraw(): Takes a double amount and returns void. (Note: Make sure the spelling matches your existing code exactly!)


2. The Retrofit (Update Existing Code) 🛠️

Goal: Tell your existing BankAccount structure that it is now officially "ATM Compatible."

File: BankAccount.java

Action: Update the class definition line.

Keyword: Use implements to connect the class to your new interface.

Hint: Since your BankAccount class already has methods named deposit, withDraw, and getBalance, do you need to write any new code inside? (Think about it!)


3. The New Contender (New Class) ₿

Goal: Create a completely different type of account that follows the same rules but works differently internally.

File Name: BitcoinWallet.java

Type: Class

Action: Implement the ATMCompatible interface.

Internal Data: It needs its own private variable for money (e.g., private double cryptoBalance).

Constructor: It needs a way to set the starting Bitcoin amount.

Methods: You must implement all three interface methods.

Logic: similar to BankAccount (add/subtract), but maybe print "BTC" instead of "$" in the console messages so you can tell the difference.

4. The Main Event (Update Logic) 🧪

Goal: Prove that the ATM doesn't care what card is inserted, as long as it fits the slot.

File: ATM.java (your main method)

Action: Change the Type of your main account variable.

From: BankAccount account = ...

To: ATMCompatible account = ...
