/*
	 * Challenge: The Java ATM Simulator
	 * 
	 * Objective: Build a console-based application that simulates a bank account,
	 * enforcing object-oriented principles, input validation, and continuous user
	 * interaction.
	 * 
	 * Technical Requirements:
	 * 
	 * 1. Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation & Class Structure)
	 * 
	 * Create a class named BankAccount.
	 * 
	 * Private Fields:
	 * 
	 * String accountHolderName
	 * 
	 * double balance
	 * 
	 * Constructor: Initialize the account with a name and an opening balance.
	 * 
	 * Methods:
	 * 
	 * void deposit(double amount): Adds money to the balance.
	 * 
	 * void withdraw(double amount): Deducts money from the balance (if sufficient
	 * funds exist).
	 * 
	 * double getBalance(): Returns the current balance.
	 * 
	 * String getAccountName(): Returns the account holder's name.
	 * 
	 * 2. Conditional Logic (Validation & Safety)
	 * 
	 * In deposit(): Ensure the deposit amount is positive (> 0). Print an error
	 * message if invalid.
	 * 
	 * In withdraw():
	 * 
	 * Check if the amount is positive.
	 * 
	 * Check if the amount is less than or equal to the current balance.
	 * 
	 * If the user tries to withdraw more than they have, print "Insufficient Funds"
	 * and deny the transaction.
	 * 
	 * 3. Loops & User Interface (The main Method)
	 * 
	 * Inside your main method, create an instance of BankAccount (e.g., "John Doe",
	 * $1000).
	 * 
	 * Use a while or do-while loop to keep the program running.
	 * 
	 * Inside the loop, display a menu:
	 * 
	 * --- ATM Menu --- 1. Check Balance 2. Deposit Money 3. Withdraw Money 4. Exit
	 * 
	 * Use a Scanner to get the user's choice and perform the corresponding action.
	 * 
	 * The program should only terminate when the user selects option 4.
	 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 * Overloading: what if a user wants to deposit a check and add a small "memo"
	 * or note about where it came from (e.g., "Salary", "Gift")?
	 * 
	 * Your Task: Inside your BankAccount class, add a second deposit method.
	 * 
	 * It must be named deposit.
	 * 
	 * It must accept two inputs: a double amount AND a String note.
	 * 
	 * Inside, it should add the amount to the balance (just like the original) and
	 * then System.out.println the note.
	 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 * Overriding: Your Task:
	 * 
	 * Create a new class SavingsAccount that extends BankAccount.
	 * 
	 * Add a constructor (you'll need to call super(name, balance)).
	 * 
	 * Override the withDraw method.
	 * 
	 * It should check if (balance - amount) is less than 500.
	 * 
	 * If it is, print "Cannot Withdraw: Minimum balance of $500 required."
	 * 
	 * If not, proceed with the withdrawal (you can copy the logic or call
	 * super.withDraw if you fix the validation there first).
	 * 
	 * Important: Don't forget the @Override annotation!
	 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 * 1. Change the class definition: public abstract class BankAccount.
