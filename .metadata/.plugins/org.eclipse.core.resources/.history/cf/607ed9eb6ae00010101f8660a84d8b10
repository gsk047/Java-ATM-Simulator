The Scenario: The Coffee Shop Queue

Imagine you are writing a small program for a coffee shop's ticket machine. You need to create a class called TicketDispenser.

The Requirements:

It should have a method named dispense().

Every time dispense() is called, it should print the next number in the sequence.

First call: "Ticket #1"

Second call: "Ticket #2"

Third call: "Ticket #3"

Your Task: Draft the code for this TicketDispenser class.
 */

public class TicketDispenser {

	private static int ticketNumber = 0;

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//dispense() is not a static method. Create an object which will call the main method
		TicketDispenser classObject = new TicketDispenser();
		
		//Call the dispense()
		classObject.dispense();
		classObject.dispense();

//		TicketDispenser.dispense();
//		TicketDispenser.dispense();

	}

	public void dispense() {
		ticketNumber++;
		System.out.println("Ticket #" + ticketNumber);

	}

}
