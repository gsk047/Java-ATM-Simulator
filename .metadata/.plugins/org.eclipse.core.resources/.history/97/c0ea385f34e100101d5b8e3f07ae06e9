	/*
	 * Challenge: The Java ATM Simulator
	 * 
	 * Objective: Build a console-based application that simulates a bank account,
	 * enforcing object-oriented principles, input validation, and continuous user
	 * interaction.
	 * 
	 * Technical Requirements:
	 * 
	 * 1. Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation & Class Structure)
	 * 
	 * Create a class named BankAccount.
	 * 
	 * Private Fields:
	 * 
	 * String accountHolderName
	 * 
	 * double balance
	 * 
	 * Constructor: Initialize the account with a name and an opening balance.
	 * 
	 * Methods:
	 * 
	 * void deposit(double amount): Adds money to the balance.
	 * 
	 * void withdraw(double amount): Deducts money from the balance (if sufficient
	 * funds exist).
	 * 
	 * double getBalance(): Returns the current balance.
	 * 
	 * String getAccountName(): Returns the account holder's name.
	 * 
	 * 2. Conditional Logic (Validation & Safety)
	 * 
	 * In deposit(): Ensure the deposit amount is positive (> 0). Print an error
	 * message if invalid.
	 * 
	 * In withdraw():
	 * 
	 * Check if the amount is positive.
	 * 
	 * Check if the amount is less than or equal to the current balance.
	 * 
	 * If the user tries to withdraw more than they have, print "Insufficient Funds"
	 * and deny the transaction.
	 * 
	 * 3. Loops & User Interface (The main Method)
	 * 
	 * Inside your main method, create an instance of BankAccount (e.g., "John Doe",
	 * $1000).
	 * 
	 * Use a while or do-while loop to keep the program running.
	 * 
	 * Inside the loop, display a menu:
	 * 
	 * --- ATM Menu --- 1. Check Balance 2. Deposit Money 3. Withdraw Money 4. Exit
	 * 
	 * Use a Scanner to get the user's choice and perform the corresponding action.
	 * 
	 * The program should only terminate when the user selects option 4.
